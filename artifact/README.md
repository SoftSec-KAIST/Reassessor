Reassessor Artifact
========

[Reassessor](https://github.com/SoftSec-KAIST/Reassessor) is an automated tool
to find different types of errors that occur in current existing reassemblers.
This artifact is designed to run the experiments in our paper. `Reassembly is
Hard: A Reflection on Challenges and Strategies` which will appear in USENIX
Security 2023.

In the first step, we will run the-state-of-art reassemblers, `Ramblr`,
`RetroWrite`, and `Ddisasm`, in a dockerized environment to reassemble dataset
binaries. Then, we will run `Reassessor` to search reassembly errors. Lastly,
we collect reassembly errors `Reassessor` found and reproduce key results of
our paper.

# Preprocessing step for experiments

### 1. Download a dataset

Download our [dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7178116) and uncompress
it on `artifact` folder. (Our published dataset does not contain SPEC CPU 2006
binaries because of a licensing issue)

```
$ cd artifact/
$ tar -xzf /path/to/dataset/benchmark.tar.gz .
$ ls dataset/
binutils-2.31.1  coreutils-8.30
```

### 2. Reassemble dataset binaries

Run `run_preproc.py` to generate reassembly files.
```
$ python3 run_preproc.py
```

`run_preproc.py` will run `Docker` commands to execute three reassemblers,
`Ramblr (commit 64d1049, Apr. 2022)`, `RetroWrite (commit 613562, Apr. 2022)`,
and `Ddisasm v1.5.3 (docker image a803c9, Apr. 2022)`.

(Optional) `run_preproc.py` supports multi-thread options so you can use it as
follows. [Caution!] We assume that a host machine has sufficient memory to run
multiple docker images, because a single docker image may require about 30~40GB
memory to reassemble large size binaries.
```
$ python3 run_preproc.py --core $(nproc)
```

Reassembly files will be generated at `./output` folder.

```
$ ls output/binutils-2.31.1/x64/clang/nopie/o0-bfd
addr2line   as-new   elfedit    ld-new  objcopy   ranlib   size     strip-new
ar          cxxfilt  gprof      nm-new  objdump   readelf  strings
$ ls output/binutils-2.31.1/x64/clang/nopie/o0-bfd/addr2line
reassem
$ ls output/binutils-2.31.1/x64/clang/nopie/o0-bfd/addr2line/reassem
ddisasm.s  ramblr.s
```

# Experiments

### 1. Search reassembly errors

This experiment will show that `Reassessor` is able to find diverse reassembly
errors, and then summarize the errors.

Run `run_reassessor.py` to search reassembly errors.

```
$ python3 run_reassessor.py --core $(nproc)
```

(Optional) The script also supports `docker` option (`--docker`), so you can
run dockerized `Reassessor` as follows.
```
$ python3 run_reassessor.py --docker
```

You can find report files that `Reassessor` made under the `errors` folders.

```
$ ls output/binutils-2.31.1/x64/clang/nopie/o0-bfd/addr2line/errors
ddisasm  ramblr
$ ls output/binutils-2.31.1/x64/clang/nopie/o0-bfd/addr2line/errors/ddisasm
disasm_diff.txt  sym_diff.txt  sym_errors.dat  sym_errors.json
```

Next, run `classify_errors.py` to classify reassembly errors that `Reassessor`
found.

```
$ python3 classify_errors.py --core $(nproc)
```

`classify_errors.py` will create `./triage` folder which contains three
`reassembler` folders:  `ramblr`, `retrowrite` and `ddisasm`. Each folder
consists with four sub-folder, `x64/pie`, `x64/nopie`, `x86/pie`, and
`x86/nopie`; each sub-folder has its own report files that contain different
types of reassembly errors.

```
$ ls triage
ddisasm  ramblr  retrowrite
$ ls triage/ddisasm/x64/nopie
E1FN.txt E1FP.txt E2FN.txt E2FP.txt E3FN.txt ...
```

Each report file has a different set of errors, and each line of the files
contains a relevant `file name`, `error type`, `reassembly code`, and
`compiler-generate code`.

Lastly, run  `get_summary.py` to examine report files containing reassembly
errors. `get_summary.py` will report the summarized results like Table 4 in our
paper.

```
$ python3 get_summary.py --core $(nproc)
```



### 2. Get the statistics of compiler-generate assembly files

This experiment examines all relocatable expressions in our benchmark and
reports the distributions of relocatable expressions for a different set of
assembly files. Also, the experiment will show that the proportion of
label-relative (Type VII) relocatable expressions in x86-64 PIE binaries is not
negligible. Moreover, it will report that existing reassembly tools,
`retrowrite` and `ddisasm`, had E7 symbolization errors for x86-64 PIE binaries
since they misidentified jump table bounds; this result implies that precise
CFG recovery is a necessary condition for sound reassembly of x86-64 PIEs.

We assume that you already ran `Experiment 1` since `get_asm_statistics.py` and
`get_e7_errors.sh` refer to data files (`gt.dat` and `sym_diff.txt`) that
`Reassessor` made.

Run `get_asm_statistics.py` to check all relocation expression types in our
benchmark. `get_asm_statistics.py` will report the distributions of relocatable
expressions for a different set of assembly Ô¨Åles.

```
$ python3 get_asm_statistics.py --core $(nproc)
```

Next, run `get_e7_errors.sh` script to check the proportion of label-relative
(Type VII) relocatable expressions in x86-64 PIE binaries is not negligible.

```
$ /bin/bash get_e7_errors.sh
```




### 3. Dissect reassembly errors

This experiment will search previously unseen FN/FP patterns.

This experiment requires the result of `Experiment 1` since `dissect_errors.sh`
examines symbolization errors in `sym_diff.txt` that `Reassessor` made.

Run `dissect_errors.sh` to find unseen reassembly error cases we reported in
section 5.4.

```
$ /bin/bash dissect_errors.sh
```

`dissect_errors.sh` reports how many reassembly files have previously unseen
errors. Also, `dissect_errors.sh` generates the report files:
`atomic_fn_cases.txt`, `atomic_fp_cases.txt`, and `label_err_fp_cases.txt`.
Each line of the files contains a relevant `file name`, `error type`,
`reassembly code`, and `compiler-generate code`. `atomic_fn_cases.txt` contains
false negative cases where reassemblers misidentfy atomic atomic relocatable
expressions as literals. `atomic_fp_cases.txt` contains false positive cases
where reassemblers falsely symbolize atomic relocatable expressions as
composite forms. Lastly, `label_err_fp_cases.txt` contains cases where
symbolized labels have the same form as in the original one, while only the
label values are misidentified.



### 4. Check reparable errors

This experiment will report how many symbolization errors would be reparable
when preventing data instrumentations.

`Experiment 1` is required since `check_reparable_errors.sh` examines the error
list files that `classify_errors.sh` generates.

Run `check_reparable_errors.sh` to get an empirical lower bound of the number
of reparable symbolization errors when preventing data instrumentation.

```
$ /bin/bash check_reparable_errors.sh
```

`check_reparable_errors.sh` will report the proportion of reparable errors that
satisfy four conditions we introduced in section 5.5.2. Also,
`check_reparable_errors.sh` will generate `reparable_errors.txt` file which
contains the list of reparable symbolization errors; each line of the file has
a relevant `file name`, `error type`, `reassembly code`, and `compiler-generate
code`.
